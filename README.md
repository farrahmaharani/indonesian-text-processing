# indonesian-text-processing
Text processing using nltk libraries. The dataset SEresult.csv is obtained from my other [repository](https://github.com/farrahmaharani/Instagram-Comment-Scraping) where I performed Instagram comment scraping.
normalisasi.csv is the additional normalized corpus and stopwords.txt is the additional stopwords. The final output is the proces.csv
